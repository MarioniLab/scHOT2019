# scHOT2019
Instructions and analysis scripts for single cell Higher Order Testing (scHOT). This code is wholly performed in R, and is split into two separate analyses, `liver` for the liver developmental data, and `MOB` for the spatial mouse olfactory bulb data.

These analyses are using publicly available data, with URLs given within the scripts.

Each folder contains an .Rmd notebook and an `output` folder containing output from running these scripts. The liver data takes approximately 4 hours to run on a local machine, and the MOB data takes approximately 3 hours to run.
